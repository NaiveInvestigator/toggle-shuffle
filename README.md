# toggle-shuffle
This simple mpv script allows you to toggle shuffle on/off during playback. This is not my script (again lol) but modified from this [comment](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/7014#issuecomment-537675768). All credits go to [@viniciusbm](https://github.com/viniciusbm). I hope this helps someone!
